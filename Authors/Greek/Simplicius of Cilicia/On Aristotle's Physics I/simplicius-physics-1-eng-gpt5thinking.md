It’s easy to grasp the aim of Aristotle’s course on the *Physics* if we remind ourselves of his division of the physical part of philosophy. Perhaps it’s even better to set out his whole division of philosophy.

Philosophy, after all, is the completion of the soul, just as medicine is the completion of the body. The soul has two parts, the irrational and the rational. And within the rational part, one side works together with the irrational—this is what he calls the intellect in potentiality—while the other is separate, namely the intellect in actuality. Every power of the soul is twofold: there is a desiderative (appetitive) power and a cognitive (knowing) power.

What perfects the desiderative side—both in the irrational element and in the potential intellect that cooperates with nonrational desires—the Peripatetics call the practical field, since it is concerned with action and has as its end the choosing and attaining of the good. What belongs to the cognitive side, whose end is truth as such, they call theoretical.

Now, insofar as theoretical inquiry perfects the knowledge of the potential intellect that, together with perception and imagination, deals with forms that are in matter and inseparable from matter, this is called natural science (physics), because it is about such things and shows that nature is present in them. But insofar as it concerns forms wholly separate from matter, and the pure activity of the intellect in actuality along with the activity of the potential intellect when it is carried up with the actual, this they call theology, first philosophy, and what comes after the physics (metaphysics), as being ranked beyond things of nature. And what is concerned with forms that are in one respect separate from matter and in another respect inseparable from it—this they call mathematics and the study On the Soul.

For they say that mathematical substance is intermediate: by its universality it has separation from matter, but by its being extended and divided it is inseparable. Likewise, they understand the soul, so far as concerns the senses and imaginations and the potential intellect, to have much that is enmattered; but so far as concerns the intellect in actuality—which Aristotle shows to be the very highest part of the soul, even if Alexander does not seem to think so—they say it has separation from matter. The other parts will receive a more exact distinction in their proper treatises.
