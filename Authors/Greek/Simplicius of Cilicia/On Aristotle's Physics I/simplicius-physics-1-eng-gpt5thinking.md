It’s easy to grasp the aim of Aristotle’s course on the *Physics* if we remind ourselves of his division of the physical part of philosophy. Perhaps it’s even better to set out his whole division of philosophy.

Philosophy, after all, is the completion of the soul, just as medicine is the completion of the body. The soul has two parts, the irrational and the rational. And within the rational part, one side works together with the irrational—this is what he calls the intellect in potentiality—while the other is separate, namely the intellect in actuality. Every power of the soul is twofold: there is a desiderative (appetitive) power and a cognitive (knowing) power.

What perfects the desiderative side—both in the irrational element and in the potential intellect that cooperates with nonrational desires—the Peripatetics call the practical field, since it is concerned with action and has as its end the choosing and attaining of the good. What belongs to the cognitive side, whose end is truth as such, they call theoretical.

Now, insofar as theoretical inquiry perfects the knowledge of the potential intellect that, together with perception and imagination, deals with forms that are in matter and inseparable from matter, this is called natural science (physics), because it is about such things and shows that nature is present in them. But insofar as it concerns forms wholly separate from matter, and the pure activity of the intellect in actuality along with the activity of the potential intellect when it is carried up with the actual, this they call theology, first philosophy, and what comes after the physics (metaphysics), as being ranked beyond things of nature. And what is concerned with forms that are in one respect separate from matter and in another respect inseparable from it—this they call mathematics and the study On the Soul.

For they say that mathematical substance is intermediate: by its universality it has separation from matter, but by its being extended and divided it is inseparable. Likewise, they understand the soul, so far as concerns the senses and imaginations and the potential intellect, to have much that is enmattered; but so far as concerns the intellect in actuality—which Aristotle shows to be the very highest part of the soul, even if Alexander does not seem to think so—they say it has separation from matter. The other parts will receive a more exact distinction in their proper treatises.

As for natural philosophy: one part deals with the first principles of all natural things—meaning, the things that are bodily—insofar as they are natural, and with what necessarily follows from such principles; another part deals with what proceeds from those principles.

Since some of these topics are simple and others composite, the work *On the Heavens* treats the simple ones. In its first two books, it discusses the fifth substance, the “heaven” in the strict sense, and among other things proves that it is eternal. In the remaining two books it treats the four elements below the moon, to the extent that these too are simple and are moved by simple motions—only so far are they taken up there. For I think it is better to put it this way, and not as Alexander says, that On the Heavens is about the eternal and the circularly moved, and even about every natural body in general, or about the cosmos. For even he agrees that this treatise is about the natural insofar as it is natural. And the composite is natural too; yet there is no discussion there of the composite, but only of the simple—just as Aristotle himself has made clear in the third book of that treatise when he says: “So, about the first of the elements we have said what sort of thing it is by nature, and that it is imperishable and ungenerated. It remains to speak about the two…,” calling “two” the two pairings of the four elements, which are governed by the two kinds of motion—away from the center and toward the center—and calling the simple things “elements.”

Now all composites are generated and perishable, whereas among the simples some are eternal, and others come to be and pass away. About the eternal, he spoke in the first books of On the Heavens; and about the generated and perishable, so far as they are simple, in the third and fourth books of that work. And when he was going to speak about the †generated, he first composed the two books On Coming-to-be and Passing-away, which set out what applies in common to all things that come to be and perish, teaching them as such. After that, further topics belong in a special way to different subjects.

What belongs to the region immediately above us he taught in the treatise *Meteorology*. As for what belongs to our own region here below: since some things are ensouled and others soulless, the soulless are taught in the treatises *On Metals*. Of the ensouled, some are animals, others plants, and others are “animal-plants” (zoophytes). Concerning animals, they discussed them in the various treatises on animals—partly in a descriptive, report-like way, as in the *Histories of Animals*, and partly by giving explanations, as in *On the Generation of Animals*, *On the Parts of Animals*, *On the Motion of Animals*, *On Sleep*, and the like. Likewise, concerning plants they taught according to this same twofold method.
