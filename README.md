Open Sourcing Translations of Ancient Literature

One problem I am upset by is the lack of accessibility of ancient literature, especially those that are mathematical, logical, and philosophical. Many have not been translated into English, and most of those that have been are costly. Using AI we should be able to translate publicly available untranslated ancient text into modern languages.
